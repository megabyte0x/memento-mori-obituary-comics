            <h2 id="quick-answer">Quick Answer</h2>
            <p>
              The safest obituary wording starts with a clear public fact, then adds family, service, memorial, and life-story language only after those details have been checked. A plain opening such as <strong>[Full name], [age], of [city], died on [date]</strong> is often better than a poetic first line that leaves readers unsure what happened.
            </p>
            <p>
              Use the examples below as wording options, not as mandatory formulas. Adapt the tone to the family, the publication rules, the public-private boundary, and the amount of room available in print or online.

              Wording problems usually become family problems when names, relationship labels, private details, or service instructions are wrong. Before sending the copy to a newspaper, funeral home, or memorial website, run this last pass.

              { question: "How do you word \"preceded in death\"?", answer: "Use a phrase such as \"He was preceded in death by his parents, [names], and his sister, [name].\" This appears before or after the list of survivors and names the close family members who died before the person. \"Predeceased by\" is an acceptable, slightly more formal alternative." },
              { question: "How do you announce a death respectfully?", answer: "Respectful announcements favor plain, gentle phrasing: \"passed away,\" \"died peacefully,\" \"entered eternal rest,\" or simply \"died on [date].\" Lead with the name and date, avoid clinical detail, and match the tone to the family's wishes and beliefs rather than to euphemism for its own sake." },
              { question: "What is good wording for the cause of death?", answer: "Cause of death is optional. Families who include it often use brief, dignified wording such as \"after a long illness,\" \"following a brief battle with cancer,\" or \"unexpectedly.\" If the cause is sensitive or private, it is entirely acceptable to omit it and write only the date of death." },
