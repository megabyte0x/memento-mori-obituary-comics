            <p>
              Do not include details that help a stranger impersonate the deceased, locate an empty home, pressure grieving relatives, or expose private medical and family information. A good obituary can still be warm, specific, and memorable without publishing every identifying fact.
            </p>
            <p>
              The safest approach is to keep a private fact sheet for the family and publish only the details that readers need: the name, a broad life context, a few meaningful memories, official service or memorial instructions, and a verified funeral-home or donation link.
