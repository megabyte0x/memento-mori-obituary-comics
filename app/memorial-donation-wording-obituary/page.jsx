            <h2 id="quick-answer">Quick Answer</h2>
            <p>
              The clearest memorial donation wording names the person, the organization, the official donation path, and how the gift should be designated. A simple version is: In memory of [Name], memorial donations may be made to [Organization Name] at [official website or mailing address].
            </p>
            <p>
              Before publishing, verify the charity name, donation link, mailing address, family-notification process, and whether the request is for a registered charity, memorial fund, scholarship, or family support. Those are different gift paths, and the obituary should make the difference clear.
