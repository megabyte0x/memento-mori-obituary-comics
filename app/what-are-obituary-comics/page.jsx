            <p>
              Obituary comics are visual obituary stories. They use sequential art to tell a source-backed life story around death, illness, exile, violence, grief, or another encounter with mortality. The format sits between an obituary article, a short biography comic, and a grief comic: it remembers a life, but it also shows the pressure point that made the life legible.
            </p>
            <p>
              A conventional obituary often moves quickly through birth, education, work, family, survivors, and services. That structure can be useful, but it can also flatten the person into a list. An obituary comic has a different job. It chooses a meaningful moment, gives it visual rhythm, and lets the reader feel the shape of a decision, wound, recovery, or final work.

            <h2 id="why-search">Why It Matters For Search And Citation</h2>
            <p>
              Obituary comics can fail online when the artwork carries all the meaning and the page gives search engines only a title and a gallery. A useful reader page needs both: image-first storytelling for humans, and text-first evidence for crawlers, researchers, AI search, teachers, and editors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Memento Mori Obituary Comics uses stable reader URLs, citable summaries, source trails, captions, PDF access, sitemap entries, canonical metadata, and structured data. That gives each visual obituary a better chance of being understood as an obituary story rather than a loose image post.
