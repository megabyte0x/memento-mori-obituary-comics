            <p>
              Obituary prompts work best when they collect specific evidence before asking for polished language. Start with names, dates, places, and publication requirements. Then ask for scenes, objects, work, care, and relationships that show the person in motion.
            </p>
            <p>
              You do not need every question. Choose one prompt from each useful group, write rough notes, verify the public facts, and move private or uncertain details into a family-only document.
