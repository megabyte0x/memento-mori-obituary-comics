            <h2 id="template-purpose">What This Template Does</h2>
            <p>
              A life story obituary template gives structure without flattening the person into a form. Use it after collecting the public facts, then add one specific scene, object, relationship, or source-backed detail that makes the life recognizable.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you only need a basic death notice, keep the obituary short. If you have room online, use the fuller template and bring in the story material from the <Link href="/obituary-checklist/">obituary checklist</Link>, <Link href="/obituary-research-guide/">obituary research guide</Link>, <Link href="/obituary-writing-prompts/">obituary writing prompts</Link>, and <Link href="/obituary-story-worksheet/">worksheet</Link>. When you need opening lines, survived-by wording, preceded-in-death wording, or service wording, use the <Link href="/obituary-wording/">obituary wording examples</Link>. Before approval, run the <Link href="/obituary-mistakes-to-avoid/">obituary mistakes checklist</Link>. If print price is the limiting factor, use the <Link href="/obituary-cost/">obituary cost guide</Link> before cutting the story down.
