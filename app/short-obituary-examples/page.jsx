            <h2 id="quick-answer">Quick Answer</h2>
            <p>
              A short obituary should still answer the public basics: who died, when, where they were connected, who should be named, whether services are public, and where memorial gifts should go. The difference is compression. Keep one specific life detail and move the fuller tribute to an online obituary, memorial page, or source-backed story.
            </p>
            <p>
              For many families, the best short obituary is not the shortest possible text. It is the shortest version that preserves accuracy, a recognizable human detail, and the next action readers need.

              A short obituary can create more mistakes than a long one because every omitted detail feels intentional. Run this pass before the newspaper proof, funeral-home page, or family announcement goes live.
