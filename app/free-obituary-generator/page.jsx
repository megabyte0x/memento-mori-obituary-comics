            <h2 id="generator-answer">What A Free Obituary Generator Should Do</h2>
            <p>
              A useful obituary generator should create an editable starting draft, not publish automatically and not invent missing facts. The safest workflow is to draft from verified details, copy the result, then review names, dates, service details, donation links, privacy boundaries, and publication rules before anyone approves the final obituary.
            </p>
            <p>
              This generator is built for families, funeral-home resource pages, newspapers, libraries, and writing guides that need a private draft builder alongside examples, templates, and proofing checklists.
