            <p>
              An obituary story is not just a longer death notice. A death notice tells people that someone died and where services will happen. An obituary story also gives readers a shaped account of the life: the facts, the setting, the pressure point, and the detail that makes the person memorable.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal is not to make grief decorative. The goal is to preserve a life with enough accuracy that family can recognize it, strangers can understand it, and future readers can cite it without guessing what is true.
