            <h2 id="quick-answer">Quick Answer</h2>
            <p>
              There is no single obituary cost. The final price depends on the exact publication, whether the notice runs in print or online, the length after newspaper formatting, photo rules, publication day, extra run days, and whether a funeral home places the notice for the family.
            </p>
            <p>
              The safest way to control the cost is to ask for a formatted quote before approval. If the print quote is high, use a short paid newspaper notice for the essential facts and publish the fuller life story online, where length and photos may be handled differently.
            </p>
