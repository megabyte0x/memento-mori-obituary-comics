            <p>
              Most obituary examples teach the basic order: announcement, biography, family, service details, and donations. These examples focus on the story layer: the scene, pressure point, source trail, and visual detail that make an obituary feel specific without losing accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Use this page when you need examples of obituary articles, visual obituaries, or life-story obituary structures. If you are writing for a newspaper or funeral-home form, start with the required facts, then use one of these patterns to make the life recognizable.
