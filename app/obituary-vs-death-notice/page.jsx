            <h2 id="quick-answer">Quick Answer</h2>
            <p>
              A death notice is usually a short public announcement: who died, when they died, and what service or memorial details people need. An obituary is usually a fuller life story: it still announces the death, but it also explains who the person was, what shaped their life, and why readers should remember them. A funeral notice is narrower still: it mainly tells people when and where to gather.
            </p>
            <p>
              The labels are not perfectly consistent. Some newspapers call family-written paid notices obituaries. Some reserve obituary for articles written by staff. Before writing, check the publication's rules and decide whether the family needs speed, story, service logistics, or all three.
