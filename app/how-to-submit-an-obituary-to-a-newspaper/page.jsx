            <h2 id="quick-answer">Quick Answer</h2>
            <p>
              To submit an obituary to a newspaper, find the paper's Obituaries, Death Notices, Classifieds, or Place an Obituary page, then follow that publication's form, email, phone, or funeral-home submission process. Most newspapers need the obituary text, submitter contact details, requested publication date, payment approval, and a way to verify the death before publication.
            </p>
            <p>
              The safest workflow is to check the newspaper's rules before writing the final version. Confirm the deadline, price, word or line limit, photo format, verification requirement, proofing process, and whether the funeral home should submit on the family's behalf.
