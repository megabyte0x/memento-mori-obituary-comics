# SEO Action Plan

Target: https://finalnotes.page/
Audit date: 2026-05-31

## Implementation Status

Completed in this pass:

- Added `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and `llms.txt`.
- Added canonical, Open Graph, Twitter card, and JSON-LD metadata to generated pages.
- Added an `/about/` editorial method page and linked it from the homepage.
- Added semantic reader-page `h1` headings plus crawlable `Citable Summary`, `Story Notes`, `Sources`, and `Download PDF` sections.
- Converted source names into linked citations in `comics.json` and per-comic `comic.json` files.
- Added page-level alt/caption summaries and image `width`/`height` attributes.
- Added renderer tests so future generated comics keep the SEO baseline.

Still open:

- Generate WebP/AVIF display variants for comic images.
- Add long-lived cache headers for stable static assets.
- Replace the remaining source summaries with fuller panel transcripts if the original panel text should be indexable verbatim.
- Deploy the updated static site to production.
